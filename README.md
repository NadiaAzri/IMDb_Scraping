# IMDb informations of all the movies and tv shows released on 2020

In this projects, I've scraped the IMDb rates, movie and tv show names, metascores and votes of all the movies and tv shows of 2020 including those which have no metascore values. The number of the page to scrape were too high so I've scraped only 1000 page, and each page has 50 movie and tv shows, the total number of movies scraped were 50000.

Language used is Python 3.8. Pycharm.

I've used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.
